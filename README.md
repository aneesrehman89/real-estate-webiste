real-estate-webiste | Html | Css | Bootstrap

I created a real estate website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.The website's design focuses on being user-friendly, so even someone who isn't Technologically Proficient can easily navigate through the website, with smooth animations and transitions that make exploring properties more engaging. It’s fully responsive, meaning it works well on all devices, from phones to computers.The use of Bootstrap helps ensure that the website looks good and functions properly no matter what screen size you’re using.
